For the assessment of cardenolide content using a genin vector pipeline, LC-MS data requires the following preprocessing steps. Raw LC-MS files were first converted from .raw to .mzML using ProteoWizard MSconvert v3.0 and then processed in MZmine 4.2.0 (mzio GmbH) using the "mzwizard" tool (Box 2 in Heuckeroth et al., 2024)  without parameter optimization. The overall feature table generated was exported for molecular network analysis. The resulting quantification file ("_quantif.csv") was refined by removing non-essential columns (D-M), renaming headers of column A (row ID), B (row mz), C (row retention time) with id, mz, and rt respectively. The number of decimals was reduced in mz (column B) to optimize filtering in R Markdown. The final processed dataset was saved as a .csv file in the "/data" folder within the appropriate R project environment. In R Studio, we filtered the feature table (.csv) obtained from the LC-MS analysis using a predefined cardenolide genins vector (see a summary version of the R markdown below). The use of the genins vector in the R markdown is limited to samples from Asclepias related origin (plant or insect material). Retention times that contained mz associated with genins were further investigated and compared with MSÂ² spectra of cardenolides isolated from Asclepias syriaca .
